Branch Structure
================================
Each branch contains at minimum two branches, master and origin. origin is the inital branch of the project, which never changes (and is used to synchronize changes to upstream freebsd). master is the primary 
changes, applied relative to origin. There will also be sub-branches, following the same toplevel structure, for -STABLE and -RELEASE branches.

For example:
* feature/blocksize/origin -> master as of commit 9d2347ae
* feature/blocksize/master -> primary codebase for feature/blocksize
* feature/blocksize/stable/9 -> blocksize mfc'd to 9-STABLE
* feature/blocksize/releng/9.2 -> blocksize mfc'd to 9.2-RELEASE
